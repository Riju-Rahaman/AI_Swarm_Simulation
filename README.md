# AI Swarm Simulation with Visualization

This project uses Q-Learning to simulate swarm intelligence in a grid environment, with live visualization of agent movements.

## Features
- **Adaptive Learning**: Q-Learning for agent decision-making.
- **Obstacle Navigation**: Agents avoid obstacles on the way to the goal.
- **Visualization**: Live grid visualization using matplotlib.

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.7+ and the required libraries (`numpy` and `matplotlib`).
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python swarm_simulation_with_visualization.py
